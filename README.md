Inspired by crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe, Crowdify allows users to create and donate (fictional) money to campaigns. Here are some features of the site: 

- Users can create campaigns and set the goal amount and deadline of their campaigns.
  - Campaign creators can adjust details of their campaign, including making it private, freezing it, or deleting it.
  - Campaign creators can also create "spend requests," which allow stakeholders have a say in the direction of the campaign.
  - Campaign creators can approve spend requests once a majority consensus threshold is reached.
- Users can donate to campaigns using their name or anonymously.
  - Once a user donates to a campaign, they are granted permission to view and vote for any active spend requests associated with the campaign.
